-p --plain = Plain Text
-m --md5 = MD5 Hashed
-c --crypt = BCrypt Hashed
-s --sha256 = sha256 hashed

-b --brute = brute force
-d --dict = dictionary attack

-i --input = File to inport passwords from
-o --output = file to output cracked password too

formating -----
    Python3 PyCrack someMd5 -m -b (Brute Force it)
    Python3 PyCrack SomeCrypt -c -d RockYou.txt
    Python3 PyCrack -i someList -o output.txt -d rockYou.txt

what we gotta do -----

make function that can create hash quickly for the dictionary word depending on what their choice was
(I.e if they said sha256 then it should know to convert each thing to sha256 vise versa)

take the file given after -d, store this file somehow
loop thru the file, encrypt the word to the correct hash, compare it to the hash we have, if it is the same return the unhashed word, if its not cont.
